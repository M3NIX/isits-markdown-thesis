# Abstract{.unnumbered}

When should I write the abstract? Do it at the very end of your thesis. Your thesis will first ask and then answer some research questions and you need to know these answers before you can start writing the abstract. It should cover your entire work, beginning with the context and motivation, continuing with the scientific task that you worked on, and finishing with the general steps and most important results. Some important questions are:

- Motivation: Why do we need your results?
- Problem statement: What problem are you trying to solve?
- Approach: How did you go about solving or making progress on the problem?
- Results: What's the answer?
- Conclusion: What are the implications of your answer?

The abstract is a way to provide the reader with the most important information of your work. In combination with the conclusion it should be sufficient to understand the whole case from motivation til result. Even though it's just a short paragraph, take good care of this part as it helps you to make a good first impression with your thesis (or a bad one).
